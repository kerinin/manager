Short Term
===
* Setup in internal health check so we can detect if a failure segfaults or is kill -9'd
* Fuzz test quitting at random times during 'ensure' blocks
* Improve consistent hashing (make more uniform)
* Test starting actual processes, daemons (upstart)

Longer Term
===
* Health checks and handlers
* Rebalance timer (rebalance after N minutes if node doesn't re-appear)
* Max active partitions, local partition cycling
